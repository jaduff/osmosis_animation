Animation of osmosis

An HTML 5 canvas animation, using collisions to simulate osmosis.
Osmosis is the movement of a solute across a semi-permeable membrane. The solvent (usually water) moves from areas of high solvent concentration to areas of low solvent concentration. This means that there is a tendency for water to move across a membrane to areas with a high concentration of osmotically active dissolved solute particles.
